# Leaf-Similar-Trees

# Given the roots of two binary trees, determine if they are "leaf-similar." Two trees are leaf-similar if their leaf value sequences (the order of leaves from left to right) are the same.

 # Approach 
To solve this problem, I used a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse each tree and collect the leaf nodes in order. Here's how it works:

#        Traversal:
For each tree, perform a DFS to visit every node.
When a leaf node (a node with no left or right children) is found, its value is added to a list.

#      Comparison:
After collecting the leaf sequences for both trees, compare the two lists.
If they are identical, the trees are leaf-similar.

#     Key Insights
DFS is Efficient: DFS ensures we visit nodes in a left-to-right order, which is crucial for maintaining the correct sequence of leaves.
Leaf Identification: A leaf node is identified when both its left and right children are None.


#     Space & Time Complexity:
Time: O(N + M), where N and M are the number of nodes in the two trees.
Space: O(N + M) to store the leaf sequences.

#      Why This Problem Matters
This problem is a great way to practice tree traversal techniques and understand how to manipulate and compare tree structures. It also highlights the importance of recursion in solving tree-based problems.

Example
Tree 1:

    3
   / \
  5   1
 / \ / \
6  2 9 8
Tree 2:

    3
   / \
  5   1
 / \ / \
6  7 4 2

Leaf Sequence for Tree 1: [6, 2, 9, 8]
Leaf Sequence for Tree 2: [6, 7, 4, 2]
Result: False (sequences don't match)

This example shows how the order of leaves mattersâ€”even if the trees look similar, their leaf sequences might differ.

Final Thoughts
This solution is clean, efficient, and leverages fundamental tree traversal concepts. Itâ€™s a great example of how breaking down a problem into smaller steps (collecting leaves, then comparing) leads to an elegant solution.
